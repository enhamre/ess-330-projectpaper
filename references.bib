title = "Global production patterns: Understanding the relationship between greenhouse gas emissions, agriculture greening and climate variability",
abstract = "Climate change due to increased greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) in the atmosphere has been consistently observed since the mid-20th century. The profound influence of global climate change on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, encompassing carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), has established a vital feedback loop that contributes to further climate change. This intricate relationship necessitates a comprehensive understanding of the underlying feedback mechanisms. By examining the interactions between global climate change, soil, and GHG emissions, we can elucidate the complexities of CO2, CH4, and N2O dynamics and their implications. In this study, we evaluate the global climate change relationship with GHG globally in 246 countries. We find a robust positive association between climate and GHG emissions. By 2100, GHG emissions will increase in all G7 countries and China while decreasing in the United Kingdom based on current economic growth policies, resulting in a net global increase, suggesting that climate-driven increase in GHG and climate variations impact crop production loss due to soil impacts and not provide climate adaptation. The study highlights the diverse strategies employed by G7 countries in reducing GHG emissions, with France leveraging nuclear power, Germany focusing on renewables, and Italy targeting its industrial and transportation sectors. The UK and Japan are making significant progress in emission reduction through renewable energy, while the US and Canada face challenges due to their industrial activities and reliance on fossil fuels.",

ABSTRACT = {The relationship between agriculture and climate change is two-sided. Agriculture is the branch of the economy most affected by the ongoing processes. It is also a large emitter of greenhouse gases and there are more and more voices about the need to reduce emissions. The purpose of the study was, based on FADN (Farm Accountancy Data Network) data, to determine the structure of greenhouse gas emissions in farms and to identify types of farms where it is possible to reduce GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions through better energy use. The emission volume was determined on the basis of the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) methodology modified for the FADN data. The emissions related to the production of energy were found to be of minor importance compared to other emission sources. Only in the horticultural crop type is the emission from the Energy section the dominant stream of GHG emission. The greatest emissions come from livestock production. Therefore, the emphasis on reducing emissions should not be placed on the Energy sector because, except for the type of horticultural farm, there is not much potential for reduction. The introduction of taxes for GHG emissions at the level of 27.31 EUR/t would reduce farm income from 21% for the type of field crops to 40% for the type of herbivorous animals. The exception is low-emission permanent crops, where the decrease in income would be only 3.85%.},

abstract = {People are not only concerned about climate change and its effects on plant and animal diversity but also about how humans are fundamentally changing the globe‚Äôs largest ecosystem that sustains economic revenue and food for many countries. We show that many species communities and ocean habitats will change from their current states. Ocean acidification and warming increase the potential for an overall simplification of ecosystem structure and function with reduced energy flow among trophic levels and little scope for species to acclimate. The future simplification of our oceans has profound consequences for our current way of life, particularly for coastal populations and those that rely on oceans for food and trade. Rising anthropogenic CO2 emissions are anticipated to drive change to ocean ecosystems, but a conceptualization of biological change derived from quantitative analyses is lacking. Derived from multiple ecosystems and latitudes, our metaanalysis of 632 published experiments quantified the direction and magnitude of ecological change resulting from ocean acidification and warming to conceptualize broadly based change. Primary production by temperate noncalcifying plankton increases with elevated temperature and CO2, whereas tropical plankton decreases productivity because of acidification. Temperature increases consumption by and metabolic rates of herbivores, but this response does not translate into greater secondary production, which instead decreases with acidification in calcifying and noncalcifying species. This effect creates a mismatch with carnivores whose metabolic and foraging costs increase with temperature. Species diversity and abundances of tropical as well as temperate species decline with acidification, with shifts favoring novel community compositions dominated by noncalcifiers and microorganisms. Both warming and acidification instigate reduced calcification in tropical and temperate reef-building species. Acidification leads to a decline in dimethylsulfide production by ocean plankton, which as a climate gas, contributes to cloud formation and maintenance of the Earth‚Äôs heat budget. Analysis of responses in short- and long-term experiments and of studies at natural CO2 vents reveals little evidence of acclimation to acidification or temperature changes, except for microbes. This conceptualization of change across whole communities and their trophic linkages forecast a reduction in diversity and abundances of various key species that underpin current functioning of marine ecosystems.}

ABSTRACT = {This study investigates the causal relationships between carbon emissions, temperature increases, and health expenditures within the framework of environmental and economic indicators. With the accelerating global impacts of climate change and rising carbon emissions, understanding their effects on public health systems has become critical. This research evaluates these interdependencies using panel causality models, dividing 115 countries into two groups‚Äîdeveloping and developed‚Äîbased on Gross National Income (GNI) per capita (PPP) and health expenditures as a percentage of GDP. Dumitrescu‚ÄìHurlin panel causality analysis was applied to examine bidirectional relationships among key indicators, including population density, temperature changes, carbon emissions, GNI, and health expenditures. The findings reveal that population density has significant causal effects on both temperature changes and carbon emissions, while carbon emissions also influence health expenditures. Moreover, the causality from population density to temperature changes is stronger in developed countries, whereas the impact of temperature changes on health expenditures is more pronounced in developing countries. These results highlight the need to strengthen climate adaptation capacities in the health systems of developing countries and implement stricter carbon emission reduction policies in developed nations as essential strategies to address these interconnected challenges.},
